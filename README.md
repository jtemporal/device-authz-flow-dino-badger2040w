# Dino Game on Badger 2040 W with Device Authz Flow 

This repo holds the file to run the Dino Game from Google Chrome coded in MicroPython and ported to Pimoroni Badger 2040 W.

The [version adapted by Jerzy GÅ‚owacki](https://github.com/niutech/dino-badger2040), here was modified to account for the interaction with an external API that holds a leaderboard and Auth0 to host the user data.

## Set Up

If you are new to the badge checkout [this lab on Auth0's Developer Center](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/labs/events/badger-2040-w).

If you are already familiar make sure to upload all the files within the `badger2040w/` folder.

Remember to update de values on `auth/config.txt` and `dino/api-config.txt` accordingly.

And have fun.
